# Object Distribution Prototype

This is a simple sandbox made to experiment with a few implementations of Poisson-Disc Sampling applied to spawning objects in a scene. The intended use of the ideas here would be to eventually integrate these algorithms with procedural terrain generation, to spawn the objects that populate the generated terrain, such as trees, bushes, rocks, etc.

Some algorithms were adapted from other sources. Whenever this is the case, the source will be listed in the file that uses it. 

A live demo of this sandbox can be seen at: https://vexventura.com/demo/object_distribution
